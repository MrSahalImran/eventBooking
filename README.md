# Event Management API

The Event Management API, built in Go using the Gin framework, is a robust solution for creating, managing, and participating in events. It offers features like CRUD operations for events, user authentication, and event registration, all secured via JWT-based authentication. Only authorized users can perform sensitive actions, with access controls ensuring data integrity. Designed for flexibility, it emphasizes usability, scalability, and security, making it ideal for event-driven platforms.


## Key Features

### Event Management
- **GET /events**: Retrieve a list of all available events.
- **GET /events/<id>**: Fetch details of a specific event.
- **POST /events**: Create a new event (authentication required).
- **PUT /events/<id>**: Update event details (authentication required, accessible only by the creator).
- **DELETE /events/<id>**: Remove an event (authentication required, accessible only by the creator).

### User Management
- **POST /signup**: Register a new user account.
- **POST /login**: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens for secure access.

### Event Participation
- **POST /events/<id>/register**: Allow users to register for a specific event (authentication required).
- **DELETE /events/<id>/register**: Cancel a user's event registration (authentication required).

## Security
- **Authentication**: Enforced using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Access Restrictions**: Ensure only event creators can modify or delete their events.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Users must present valid JWT tokens to access protected routes.

This API provides a robust foundation for managing events while ensuring security and ease of use for both organizers and participants.
