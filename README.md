# Event Management API

The Event Management API is designed to support a platform where users can create, manage, and participate in events. The API includes endpoints to handle CRUD operations for events, user authentication, and event registration. Security measures, including JWT-based authentication, ensure that only authorized actions are performed.

## Key Features

### Event Management
- **GET /events**: Retrieve a list of all available events.
- **GET /events/<id>**: Fetch details of a specific event.
- **POST /events**: Create a new event (authentication required).
- **PUT /events/<id>**: Update event details (authentication required, accessible only by the creator).
- **DELETE /events/<id>**: Remove an event (authentication required, accessible only by the creator).

### User Management
- **POST /signup**: Register a new user account.
- **POST /login**: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens for secure access.

### Event Participation
- **POST /events/<id>/register**: Allow users to register for a specific event (authentication required).
- **DELETE /events/<id>/register**: Cancel a user's event registration (authentication required).

## Security
- **Authentication**: Enforced using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Access Restrictions**: Ensure only event creators can modify or delete their events.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Users must present valid JWT tokens to access protected routes.

This API provides a robust foundation for managing events while ensuring security and ease of use for both organizers and participants.
